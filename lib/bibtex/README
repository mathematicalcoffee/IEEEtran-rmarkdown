IEEEtran.bst is the official BibTeX style for authors of the Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Transactions journals and
conferences.

It also may have applications for other academic work such as theses and
technical reports. The alphanumeric and natbib variants extend the
applicability of the IEEEtran bibstyle family to the natural sciences
and beyond.

The IEEEtran bibstyle is a very comprehensive BibTeX style which provides
many features beyond the standard BibTeX styles, including full support
for references of online documents, patents, periodicals and standards.
See the provided user manual for detailed usage information.

The latest version of the IEEEtran BibTeX style can be found at CTAN:

http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ieeetran

as well as within IEEE's site:

http://www.ieee.org/

Note that the packages at IEEE's site do not contain the natbib and
alphanumeric variants (e.g., IEEEtranN.bst, etc.) as these are not used
for IEEE related work. These files can be obtained on CTAN.
